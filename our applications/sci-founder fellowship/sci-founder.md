### What is your company going to pursue? Please describe your technology and what it does or will do. If you have a website, please share it here too.

A community-driven academic publishing platform and a knowledge repository, that also offers an alternative way to how scholars make their living and fund their research.

The core of the platform is the ability to link the content together and use the points-based voting mechanics to help filter and curate content, thus making the discovery of relevant, high quality, trusted research easy. With these reputation points that users earn by posting their content, we aim to provide a new metric for academic contributions that replaces h-index, and we plan to integrate payments that distribute available funding to researchers based on those metrics, thus completely disrupting the academic business model.

Additionally, we’ll be building a suite of digital services and tools, under the same umbrella of “Unfold Research”, including e-lab notebooks, peer review system, reference management, data collection and verification, project funding and supervision, conference organizer,… that are all integrated together, and create a seamless and pleasant experience for scholars, that have been, historically, accustomed to very pricey and cumbersome experiences and workflows.

We’re rethinking the dynamics of academia and building the infrastructure for the entire community of scholars to work together and help us get to a version of academia that we all want, that is more fair and open, and easier to work within. We’re building academia 2.0.

### Why is this a big deal if it works?

We will reinvent how science is being funded, done, shared and discovered, attracting new generations of future scholars and gaining a dramatically faster pace of progress as a species.

We think that there’s a better way to do science, and we’re far from being alone in that thinking. And while other industries have much easier and standardized ways for people in them to make progress, make a sustainable living, and collaborate, academia has suffered heavily due to misaligned and wrong incentives, greed, and a number of outdated legacy reasons.

We aim to provide incentives that will be sufficient at giving momentum for a change and building an infrastructure to support that development.

Disrupting a 200-year old industry is a tough effort, but since every other industry has roots in this one, the issues are even more important and urgent to solve. Science is how we humans make a better environment, how we solve other big and urgent problems, how we utilize our creativity and innovate, and how we reach new worlds.

Underutilized technological capabilities and incredibly frustrating, unfair, obscure and cumbersome processes are the reason why a lot of people are leaving academia, why they spend hundreds of hours doing tedious stuff instead of focusing on what they do best, and why large chunks of work aren’t discovered in time and used cross-domains. Improving those areas could lead to a surge of better science.

### Why do you want to work on this? What is your personal motivation?

I had a great math teacher in 4th grade. She instilled into the core of my personality her favorite saying that “math is not just about math, it’s about life”. Ever since, I had an interest in natural sciences, growing from math, toward programming (I’ve spent ~7 years in computer graphics research during high-school and college), then physics, and evolving into the theory of complexity, AGI and qualia through which I ended up focusing on computation and theoretical computer science in general (the last ~4 years).

During this phase of learning, I’ve felt the pitfalls of academia on numerous occasions, and it had always frustrated me, because science was “supposed” to be dynamic, pure and magical; but it was anything but that. I was angry and sad.

As I was becoming proficient with software development and web, I realized that, perhaps even the biggest, impact that I could have is by building exactly what myself and others need - an infrastructure for how the science was supposed to be.

I started building my first startup - Nodebook, a graph-based collaboration hub. I failed. I failed hard. I hit $0 on my account several times. And yet, I enjoyed what I was doing. I’m not saying I’ve done it ideally, but it was a useful experience, and the one that pushed me through hundreds of shitty days filled with headaches - yet I persevered. There’s not one thing that I would like to spend my time more on (maybe doing qualia research). I’ve decided with myself that the fight is worth it - literally, an entirety of human race progress could benefit from it. And for that, I will gladly wake up every next day, sit my ass on the chair and see which next few lines of code will make a difference.

### Who are the founders on your team? Please include a mini bio (3 bullet points) for each as well as email addresses.

Dragan Okanovic <br>
\- senior web full-stack developer, ex 3d computer graphics (total of ~7 years in the industry) <br>
\- done research in computer graphics, physics, abstract math, complexity, machine learning, computation and published a paper <br>
\- has 3 large whiteboards in his apartment

### What is the most impressive thing each founder has ever done?

Dragan:
I failed hard, yet I didn’t give up.
It is true that during hardships we start recognizing what matters to us - despite difficulties, we deem some things more important and try to preserve them first. I discovered that being able to work on research, and work for research, are things that I really enjoy, those are the things that can easily keep me up at 2am (such is the case while writing this) and wake me up before the alarm - those are the things more important than my fear of failure. Persevering, and not asking “if” something will happen, but only focused on expediting “when” it will happen, that’s something that I admire the most about myself.

### Who would be able to start working on this full time within the next 6 months?

Dragan. With the funding, there’d be enough time and resources to find more developers as well.

### Who are the inventors? Have you discussed the intellectual property with others (your PI/institution)?

n/a - everything could be developed in-house.

### How much (if anything) has been proven so far?

On our side, very little (still quite early in development and with a full-time job).

But we have examples from Open Science Framework (OSF) and Papers with Code partnering with arXiv and other services, that open publishing platforms and crowd-sourced knowledge can work in academia! There are examples of Wikipedia, StackExchange and Github, further proving that working in the open and being community-driven is possible. This gives us very good reasons to be very optimistic, in addition to the fact that we’ll be providing even better incentives and, eventually, better features.

### Feel free to mention any other material (papers, patents).

n/a

### What is the major milestone you might want to go after in the next year? What are the resources you might need for that?

Building core of the publishing platform (i.e. v1.0), launching for one research area, and offering new metrics, and alternative funding model, and proving that they *can work*. Having one niche’s needs covered as a proof of concept is an important milestone, for us, as well as the entire academia.

As a software company, the majority of our costs would go into salaries for more web developers (min 1, max 4, for the first year). Web devs in Serbia can range from 2k (medior) to 5k (senior) per dev, per month.

### What are the biggest challenges? How would this be most likely to fail?

The architecture of Unfold will be distributed and asynchronous, and will present decent technical challenges, but far from impossible or unknown. We’d be dealing with file uploading and processing, data aggregation for the voting system, indexing and fast searching, versioning of different primitives on the system and multiple ways for caching and requests optimization. These are hard, but still known technical challenges.

Two types of challenges that are less known are: 1) user acquisition and retention, and 2) general social adoption of the new metrics that we will introduce.

Our approach to user acquisition is to go one research area at a time (instead of opening it publicly at once). Our goal is to completely satisfy that one group of users, and gather useful feedback and insights that will enable us to continuously improve and balance the platform, while still being able to maintain full control and focus.

The general adoption of our work throughout academia will require us to work with many other institutions and organizations, collaborating on providing integrations and making it painfully easy for them to make a switch to our services and start using metrics, thus helping us reach more scholars with our ideas.

### Where do you plan to be based? If outside the San Francisco Bay Area (where we will help you find lab space), please describe how you get access to any lab space and equipment you will need.

Belgrade, Serbia. All devs could work from home. No need for any special equipment, just laptops and cloud infrastructure.

### Do you know of any competitors to what you want to develop? Why do you think you can win?

The most similar are OSF and Octopus Science as publishing platforms, ResearchGate and Papers with Code as services that combine publications with some extra linked content, and QuartzOA for alternative funding, however, they’re still very far from our bigger vision and still poses only a partial overlap.

The biggest reason for their partial success (and perhaps eventual failure) is that they do not provide an incentive for people to make a switch, or to invest themselves into using their products. Yes, there’s maybe an interesting feature here and there, but the value is lacking.

We will focus on providing value to a small number of people at the time, and that gradual acquisition is at the core of what we will do differently, and combined with practically useful incentives (payments), we believe that our strategy is strong enough to continue expanding user base without a huge churn that most academic services experience.
